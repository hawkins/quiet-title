# Quiet Title

Quiet Title is a simple Chrome extension that replaces YouTube videos with their quieter / differently formatted versions. **BECAUSE ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE IS ANNOYING!**

## Installation

Either [install via Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quiet-title/kilcdnpklmenachjilknpbkgbjfhnime)...

...or install manually by downloading this repository via the `Download ZIP` button on the right.
Unzip it and place the folder somewhere you can find it, like your desktop.
Next open up Chrome, go to the menu in the upper right, settings, then extensions.
Check the `Developer mode` box in the upper right.
Finally, click the `Load unpacked extension...` and navigate to the folder.


## Usage

Click the icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension action. From here you can select any of the quieting options, which will then refresh your page if you're on YouTube.com (and keep your video progress, too!).
